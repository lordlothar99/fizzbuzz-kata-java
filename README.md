## Statement

### Problem Description

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples
of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of
five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and
five print "FizzBuzz ".

Sample output:

    1
    2
    Fizz
